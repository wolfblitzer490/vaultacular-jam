Shop1,2,"Greetings... Commerce Badge, please."
Shop2,3,Oh... you don't have a Commerce Badge.
Shop3,4,You can't shop here without a Commerce Badge.

Shop5,6,"Oh, that's right... Minister Northrup is away at the hot springs spa up in the mountains."
Shop6,7,There's not much I can do for you until the minister gets back from his vacation.
Shop7,-6,It sure is hard to walk away from those hot springs...

Shop8,9,I can't believe the state of things around here!
Shop9,10,Don't look at me like that. I brought this wine from home. It's considered rustic to drink from the bottle!
Shop10,-10,"No, you don't need a Commerce Badge to have some wine, but I'm not sharing anyways. My nerves are a wreck!"

,,Water Porter
Well1,,"A traveler, eh? The well is good and full, but the water’s been tasting strange these days. "
Well2,,I carry the water to whoever needs it. That’s my job. But the flavor is my passion!
Well3,,"In some seasons, the water is earthy and mellow. Other times it is sweet and bright. But recently it tastes… wrong. "
Well4,,"Say, maybe I’ve just been drinking this stuff for too long. Maybe it’s my tongue that’s gone strange. I guess I wouldn’t know, because this is the only water I drink."
Well5,,I wonder how the water tastes in other places…
,,"[player has water skin to offer, prompting next strings; else repeat 5]"
Well6,,For me? Oh my! …
,,…
,,…
Well7,,"Fascinating. This water brings me back to my childhood. Notes of summer leaves, horse hooves. Yes… incredible! This water tastes like how water should."
Well8,,I guess it’s true after all. It’s not just me. Something is strange with the flavor of our water here.
Well9,,…
,,Could it be?
,,…
,,… But what else…?
Well10,,What’s that? Oh… I was lost in thought. Think I’ll go drink some more water.
,,[prompt 11 and 12 when player has defeated goblins IF water skin was given]
Well11,,Do you see? This is just the sort of thing that will ruin a water table!
Well12,,I don’t know if I’ll stay here any longer. There’s bound to be better water out there.
,,[prompt 13 when player has defeated goblins IF water skin was NOT given]
Well13,,AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!! 
,,[Water Porter jumps into the Well]
